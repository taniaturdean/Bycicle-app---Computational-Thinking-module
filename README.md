# Bycicle-app---Data-Analytics-2-module

CycleYourWay is a cycling app whose main purpose is to improve cyclcing experience by informing users about the safety conditions in London (weather, location, light condition).It was built using open-source transport data. It also allows users to share real-time accidents data.

I built the app prototype in Python (the code is provided in the app folder). My other contribution to this project was the Python visual in the visual folder. The report (the main pdf file) was written in a team of 6 UCL students. It analyses the bussines impact of the app prototype and also contains some technical considerations. I also contributed on writing the technical considerations. The report also has Tableau visuals of the open source data (see Visual 1 on page 12 for a 4-dimensional Tableau visual I created).
